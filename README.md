# TikTok Claim vs Opinion Classification Project

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world TikTok data science workflow to build a predictive model that classifies whether a video contains a factual claim or an opinion. The goal is to help reduce content moderation backlog by prioritizing reported videos more efficiently.

The project follows the PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) framework used in professional analytics teams.

## Business Problem
TikTok receives a high volume of user-reported videos that require moderation. Manually reviewing all reports creates delays and inefficiencies. A reliable classification model can help prioritize videos that contain factual claims and require faster review.

## Project Scope
- Project planning and proposal using the PACE framework
- Data understanding and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Machine learning model development
- Model evaluation and communication of insights

---

## Dataset
- TikTok video dataset containing features related to video metadata and user reports
- Used to determine whether a video contains a claim or an opinion

---

## Tools & Technologies
